            <p> My wife and I recently went on a cruise to Mexico. 
                We crossed a relatively calm Gulf of Mexico while 
                Hurricane Harvey was battering Houston.</p>

                    <p>The seas were calm and the weather was beautiful 
                        on our port days in Cozumel and Puerto Progreso.</p>

                <p>Our cruise began and ended in New Orleans. While in New Orleans
                    we had lunch at Chickie Wah Wah. This unassuming sandwich shop is actually
                    the 2017 best new restaurant in the nation according to both Bon Apppetit and Food and Wine.</p>

                <p>Accoring to my wife a couple of times durring the trip I was 
                   the "extra special" version of myself. I know that this is true
                   because at those times she gave me that special look she gives me 
                   to let me know how much she loves and appreciates me.
